When it comes to proposals, everyone wants something unforgettable. Something that makes your partner''s heart skip a beat every time they remember it.

And while there are countless ways to pop the big question, a beach proposal remains one of the most romantic choices.

Imagine the two of you walking hand in hand, waves crashing gently, the breeze brushing against your skin… and then, you kneel, ring in hand, asking the question of a lifetime.

But what if you could make it even more enchanting; an experience impossible to forget?

If your answer is yes, then this guide is for you.

Why Choose a Beach Proposal?
Fair question. Beaches aren''t for everyone.

But if your girlfriend has ever posted a beach sunset, or mentioned wanting "something romantic by the water," then yeah, the beach makes sense.

The setup is already there and the ocean does half the work plus you get good natural light for photos.

And if you pick the right spot, you''re not fighting for space with other people''s birthday parties and loud music.

That said, if she''s the type who hates sand in her shoes or gets hot easily, maybe reconsider. A beach proposal only works if she''d actually enjoy being at the beach.

First thing to do
This is where most guys mess up.

They plan the proposal they think looks good, not the one she''d want. Then they''re confused when she says yes but doesn''t seem as excited as they expected.

So before you book anything, pay attention. Not just to the big obvious hints, but to the small stuff:

Does she save proposal videos on Instagram? What kind?
When friends get engaged, what does she comment on? The ring? The location? How private it was?
Has she ever said "I would hate if…" about someone else''s proposal?
Does she care more about the moment itself or the photos after?
If you''re not sure, ask indirect questions. "Where do you think would be a cool place for a proposal?" or "Would you want people around or just us?"

Her answers tell you everything.

Planning Your Beach Proposal
Alright, so you''ve decided on the beach. Now what?

1. Pick the Right Time
Sunset is obvious for a reason. The light is good, it''s cooler, and the whole vibe just works for proposals.

In Lagos, that''s usually between 5:30 and 6:30 PM depending on the time of year.

Sunrise works too if she''s a morning person and you want something quieter.

2. Choose Your Beach Carefully
Not all Lagos beaches are proposal material.

Public beaches on weekends? Crowded. Noisy. Someone''s cousin will photobomb your pictures.

You want somewhere that gives you space and doesn''t look like a regular hangout spot. That usually means going through a resort or private beach club that can give you access to a section of the beach.

If you don''t want the stress of logistics, hire a planner or work with the resort''s in-house team. Many resorts, like Ziba Beach Resort, offer proposal packages where we handle the setup, so you just show up and enjoy your moment.

3. Keep the Setup Simple (But Intentional)
You don''t need to recreate a Nollywood movie scene.

Candles in glass holders (so they don''t blow out), some flowers, maybe fairy lights if it''s getting dark. That''s enough.

The mistake people make is overdoing it. Twenty different types of decorations, balloons, signs, props, etc.

Pick the elements you want and make them count. E.g. Candles or lanterns for ambiance, flowers (her favorites, not just roses because that''s what everyone does), something personal (a photo of you two, a meaningful object), etc

If you''re not good at this stuff, hire someone or work with the resort''s event team. Don''t try to DIY it the morning of and hope for the best.

4. Sort Out Food and Drinks
Champagne is standard. But if she doesn''t drink or prefers something else, get that instead.', '/ziba-blog/blog-1.jpg', 'Ziba Beach Resort', 'Proposals', 8, NOW(), NOW(), NOW()),

'Why Ziba Beach Resort is Ideal for Weddings

Planning your wedding at a beach destination is pure magic if executed well.

But when it comes to finding the right venue, the pressure can be overwhelming. From coordinating logistics to ensuring your guests have the experience of a lifetime, a lot is on the line.

After years of hosting hundreds of couples, we''ve learned what makes a wedding venue truly special. And we''ve synthesized that knowledge into this guide.

Read on to discover what makes Ziba an ideal wedding destination.

The Perfect Backdrop
Your wedding photos are going to live forever. Or at least, they''re going to feature prominently in your parents'' living room for the next 20 years.

So the venue matters. A lot.

At Ziba Beach Resort, every angle is Instagram-worthy. From sunrise to sunset, the light hits just right. The beach is pristine, the water is clear, and the natural landscape provides all the backdrop you need without looking overdone.

Unlike some venues that require a truckload of decorations to look presentable, Ziba already has the setup. You enhance it, you don''t create it from scratch.

Private Beach Access
Your wedding is personal. You don''t want random beachgoers wandering into your photos.

With Ziba Beach Resort, you get exclusive access to a private section of the beach. Your guests can celebrate without feeling cramped or interrupted. There''s enough space for ceremonies, receptions, dancing, and still have room for activities.

Expert In-House Event Team
Here''s the difference between a good wedding and a stress-free wedding: having a professional team that knows exactly what they''re doing.

The Ziba Beach Resort events team has hosted countless weddings. They know what works, what doesn''t, where things go wrong, and how to fix them before you''ve even thought about them.

From ceremonies to receptions, dinner services to late-night entertainment, they coordinate everything. You show up, look beautiful, and enjoy your day.

Accommodation for Your Guests
One of the biggest logistics challenges for a beach wedding is getting your guests there and making sure they''re comfortable.

With Ziba, your guests can stay on the property. No rushing back and forth from hotels miles away. They wake up on the beach, celebrate with you, and can still enjoy the resort amenities after the reception.

This also means you get more quality time with the people who matter most. Instead of guests leaving right after dinner, they''re around for dancing, lawn games, and those random 2 AM conversations that become your favorite memories.

Flexible Setups and Packages
Every couple is different. Some want an intimate gathering of 50 people, others are planning for 500.

Ziba offers flexible packages and setups to accommodate different wedding sizes and styles. Whether you''re envisioning a casual beachside celebration or a formal multi-day event, the infrastructure and expertise are there to make it happen.

Delicious Food and Beverage Options
Your wedding food is going to be talked about. For better or worse.

Ziba''s culinary team specializes in creating menus that blend local flavors with international cuisine. Everything is fresh, beautifully plated, and designed to impress. They can accommodate dietary restrictions, cultural preferences, and specific requests without compromise.

And the drinks flow smoothly throughout the event. From the welcome cocktail to the late-night shots, you''ve got options.

Affordable Luxury
Beach weddings have a reputation for being expensive.

But here''s the thing: you don''t need to spend like a tech billionaire to have an incredible wedding.

Ziba Beach Resort offers premium wedding experiences at prices that don''t require you to remortgage your parents'' house or delay your honeymoon indefinitely.

You get luxury, professionalism, and stunning aesthetics without the eye-watering price tag.

The Bottom Line
A beach wedding isn''t just a wedding—it''s an experience. It''s a memory your guests will talk about for years.

Ziba Beach Resort makes that experience seamless and unforgettable.

From the sunrise moment you wake up on your wedding day to the late-night dancing under the stars, every detail is thought through. Every logistics problem is solved. Every timeline runs smoothly.

You get to be a couple getting married at a dreamy beach location.

'Experience Ziba: Family Dinner at Sunset

There is something magical about dining as a family by the ocean. The sun melting into the horizon. The sound of waves crashing in the background. Good food. Good company.

Yet family dinners have become increasingly rare.

Everyone is busy. Work deadlines, school runs, phone notifications constantly pulling attention away. The idea of carving out time to sit down together, without distractions, feels almost impossible.

But here''s the thing: those moments are the ones that matter most.

At Ziba Beach Resort, we''ve designed the family dinner experience to be exactly what your family needs. A space to reconnect, to laugh, to simply be together.

The Setting
Imagine walking onto the beach just as the sun is starting its descent. The light is golden. The temperature is perfect. The crowd is minimal because it''s not peak "busy" time.

You''re seated at a table with the best view of the ocean. There''s no queue for the buffet, no shouting to be heard over chaos, no rushed feeling like you need to finish and leave.

It''s calm. It''s peaceful. It''s yours.

The Food
Here''s where it gets interesting. We''ve curated a menu specifically for family dining.

That means a selection of dishes that appeal to different tastes. The kids can get something they''re excited about. You and your partner can try something more adventurous. Grandma gets her preferred protein prepared exactly how she likes it.

Everything is fresh. Everything is flavorful. And it all comes out at a pace that lets you enjoy the meal rather than feel rushed.

The Activities
After dinner, as the sun disappears and the evening breeze picks up, the experience doesn''t end.

Depending on the season, there might be lawn games on the beach, a bonfire with s''mores, live music, or simply the space to walk along the shore and talk.

It''s designed flexibility. You can engage as much or as little as you want. Some families want the full package. Others prefer to stay at the table and watch the sunset while catching up.

Both work. Both are beautiful.

Why This Matters
In a world that constantly demands our attention and energy, family time is becoming more precious.

Your kids won''t remember the extra hours you worked. They won''t recall the email you should have answered. But they will remember the evening they watched the sunset with you, ate good food, and felt like the most important people in your life.

And honestly? You will too.

Booking Your Family Dinner
Family dinners at Ziba Beach Resort are available on weekends and select weekdays.

We recommend booking in advance, especially during peak seasons, to ensure you get your preferred date and time.

Packages start with the dining experience and can be customized to include additional activities, private beach access, or overnight accommodation if you want to extend the magic.

The Cost of Moments
A family dinner at Ziba isn''t the cheapest evening out. But it''s not meant to be.

It''s meant to be the kind of experience you look back on years later and think, "That was worth it. That mattered."

Because it does.

Your family deserves that. And so do you.', '/experience-ziba/family-dinner.jpg', 'Ziba Beach Resort', 'Travel Tips', 6, NOW(), NOW(), NOW()),

'Travel Guide: Best Time to Visit Lagos Beaches

Lagos is a city that pulses with life. Vibrant culture, diverse food scene, bustling markets, and so much more.

But what makes Lagos truly special for beach lovers is that the beaches are accessible year-round.

Still, timing matters. Some seasons are better than others depending on what you''re looking for.

The Dry Season (November to March)
Pro: Perfect weather. Cool mornings, warm afternoons, minimal rain.
Pro: Clear skies, great for photos and outdoor activities.
Pro: Lower humidity, so you''re not drenched in sweat.
Con: Higher prices. Tourism peaks, hotels raise rates.
Con: Busier beaches, more crowds.

Best For: People who want guaranteed good weather and don''t mind the crowds. Also ideal if you''re planning a wedding or proposal.

The Harmattan Season (December to February)
This is technically part of the dry season, but worth highlighting.

A cool, dry wind blows from the Sahara. Combined with the dry season weather, this creates the most comfortable climate.

Temperature is cooler (around 25-28°C), the air is clearer, and it''s just generally the most pleasant time to be on the beach.

Downside: Peak tourism season means premium prices.

Best For: People prioritizing comfort and don''t have budget constraints.

The Transition Season (April to May, September to October)
Pro: Weather is still decent, though a bit more unpredictable.
Pro: Fewer crowds than the dry season.
Pro: Lower prices than peak season.
Con: Occasional rain showers, though rarely all-day affairs.
Con: Higher humidity.

Best For: Budget-conscious travelers, people avoiding crowds, those wanting a balance between weather and affordability.

The Wet Season (June to August)
Pro: Cheapest rates. Significantly lower prices compared to other seasons.
Pro: Fewer tourists, less crowded beaches.
Con: Frequent rain, though usually in short bursts.
Con: Higher humidity, so it feels hot and sticky.
Con: Ocean waves can be rough, so swimming might be less pleasant.

Best For: Budget travelers, surfers (actually great waves), people who don''t mind a bit of rain.

Recommendations
If You Want Perfect Weather: December to February (Harmattan season)
If You Want Good Weather and Lower Crowds: April, May, September, October
If You Want Budget Options: June to August
If You Want a Mix of Everything: November or March

Pro Tip: Book weekday visits if possible. Same beaches, fewer people, sometimes lower prices.

Holidays and Special Events
Lagos hosts several events throughout the year that bring crowds:

Carnival (March/April): Festive atmosphere but very crowded.
Christmas Season (December): Family holidays, peak tourism.
New Year (January): Popular for celebrations, expensive.

These dates offer great energy but come with higher prices and bigger crowds.

Plan accordingly if you''re trying to avoid either.

The Bottom Line
Lagos beaches are beautiful any time of year. But when you go matters.

Choose based on your priorities:
- Weather comfort
- Budget
- Crowd preference
- Specific events or occasions

At Ziba Beach Resort, we''re open year-round and ready to host you whenever you decide to visit. Each season brings its own charm.

The best time to visit Lagos beaches is simply the time that works best for you.', '/ziba-blog/blog-4.jpg', 'Ziba Beach Resort', 'Travel Tips', 9, NOW(), NOW(), NOW()),

'Planning a Beach Wedding: Budget Guide for Lagos Couples

Beach weddings are dreamy. But they can also be financially intimidating.

How much does one actually cost? What are the hidden expenses? Is it cheaper or more expensive than a traditional venue wedding?

This guide breaks it down.

Average Cost Breakdown
When you''re planning a beach wedding in Lagos, here''s what typically goes into the budget:

Venue: ₦500,000 - ₦2,000,000+ (depending on guest count and location)
Catering: ₦150,000 - ₦500,000+ (per head, adjustable based on menu)
Decor & Flowers: ₦200,000 - ₦800,000
Rentals (Tables, Chairs, Tents): ₦300,000 - ₦1,000,000
Entertainment (DJ, Live Band): ₦200,000 - ₦1,000,000
Photography & Videography: ₦300,000 - ₦1,500,000
Invitations & Favors: ₦100,000 - ₦400,000
Miscellaneous (permits, tips, etc.): ₦150,000 - ₦500,000

Total (ballpark for 200 guests): ₦2,500,000 - ₦7,000,000

That''might seem like a lot, but context matters.

Beach Venue vs. Traditional Venue
Here''s a common misconception: beach weddings are always more expensive.

Actually, they can be:

More Affordable: A beach venue might require less decor since nature already provides the backdrop.

More Expensive: Adding elements like tents, additional lighting, and ensuring guest comfort on the sand can add costs.

What Matters: Choosing the right venue partner who understands beach logistics and can control costs.

At Ziba Beach Resort, we''ve structured packages to reduce hidden costs. Your setup, timeline, and unexpected expenses are all factored in upfront.

Budget Breakdown by Priority
Scenario 1: Luxury Beach Wedding (₦5M - ₦7M+)
- Premium catering with international cuisine
- Full event coordination
- Professional photography for 2 days+
- Elaborate decor and floral arrangements
- Accommodation for key guests
- Multiple entertainment options

Scenario 2: Mid-Range Beach Wedding (₦3M - ₦5M)
- Quality catering with good menu options
- Partial event coordination (you handle some)
- Professional photography for the event day
- Tasteful decor and flowers
- Entertainment (DJ or live band, not both)
- Some guest accommodation arrangements

Scenario 3: Budget-Friendly Beach Wedding (₦1.5M - ₦3M)
- Good catering but simpler menu
- DIY decor with professional touches
- Photography (quality but limited hours)
- Basic entertainment (DJ)
- Limited accommodation arrangements

How to Save Money
1. Off-Peak Dates
Marrying during low season (June-August) or off days (Wednesdays-Fridays) can reduce venue costs by 30-50%.

2. Smaller Guest List
Fewer guests = lower catering and logistics costs. A 100-person beach wedding is significantly cheaper than 300.

3. Simplified Decor
Let the ocean be your decor. Minimal flowers, strategic lighting, and good photography can create a stunning aesthetic without excessive decoration.

4. Buffet Over Plated Meals
Buffet catering is typically 20-30% cheaper than plated service and guests often appreciate the variety.

5. Digital Invitations
Skip printed invites, save money, help the environment.

6. Hire a Strong Event Coordinator
This might seem counterintuitive, but a good coordinator actually saves you money. They know how to negotiate, avoid expensive mistakes, and maximize your budget.

7. Limit the Liquor Package
Open bars are expensive. Set drink limits or pre-select certain beverages to control costs.

8. Use Local Vendors
Music from local DJs, flowers from local florists, decor from local suppliers. Support local and save 15-25%.

7. Skip the Destination Flight
If possible, choose a beach venue accessible by road. You save on flights for you and your wedding party.

What NOT to Skimp On
While saving money is important, some things are worth the investment:

Photography & Videography: Your wedding memories depend on this. Don''t hire your friend''s cousin.

Catering: Bad food ruins the vibe. Quality catering is essential.

Venue & Event Coordination: A good venue partner prevents disasters. Worth every naira.

Guest Comfort: Bathrooms, shade, seating—these matter. Don''t ignore them.

Summary
A beach wedding in Lagos doesn''t have to drain your savings. With thoughtful planning, smart choices, and the right venue partner, you can create an incredible experience within your budget.

Start with your total budget, work backward from your non-negotiables, and find the vendor partners (like Ziba Beach Resort) who can deliver excellence at your price point.

'Romantic Getaway Ideas for Couples in Lagos

Marriage these days requires intentional effort. Between work, kids, and daily responsibilities, romance often falls to the bottom of the priority list.

But romance is the glue that keeps relationships strong.

That''s why couples need getaways. Not just vacations where you''re running around seeing sights. But intentional time away where it''s just you, your partner, and nothing else competing for attention.

If you''re based in Lagos (or nearby), here are some romantic getaway ideas that actually work.

1. Beach Sunset Experience
Simple. Underrated. Incredibly romantic.

Pick a quiet beach spot (not the busy public beaches), arrive as the sun is setting, bring good food and drinks, sit together, and just exist.

No agenda. No itinerary. No trying to make it Instagram-perfect.

Just the ocean, the sky changing colors, and each other.

Ziba Beach Resort offers private beach experiences designed exactly for this. You can add candles, soft music, a personalized menu—or keep it minimalist. Your choice.

Cost: ₦200,000 - ₦500,000 depending on what you add

2. Overnight Beach Retreat
One night away is often enough to reset.

Book a nice room with an ocean view, spend the evening on the beach, wake up to the sound of waves, have breakfast overlooking the water, and head back.

You''re not jet-lagged from traveling. You''re not spending a fortune. But you''ve created space to reconnect.

Cost: ₦300,000 - ₦1,000,000 depending on accommodation choice

3. Adventure Activity Together
Couples that do new things together grow together.

If your usual date night is dinner and a movie, try something active: kayaking, paddleboarding, beach volleyball, snorkeling (if water is clear enough), or a beach hike at sunset.

The activity gives you something to do besides stare at each other and worry you''ll run out of conversation. (You won''t. But sometimes a distraction helps.)

Cost: ₦100,000 - ₦300,000

4. Couples Spa & Massage
Stress kills romance. So does tension and sore shoulders.

Book a couples'' massage or spa experience. It''s relaxing, it''s intimate without being awkward, and let''s be honest—massages are amazing.

Many beachfront resorts offer spa packages.

Cost: ₦150,000 - ₦400,000 for 2 people

5. Private Dining Experience
Cooking together, being served a beautiful meal, or having a private dinner setup just for you two.

Different than a restaurant date because it''s intimate and personalized.

Ziba can arrange private dining on the beach—your own table, your own space, your own timeline.

Cost: ₦400,000 - ₦1,000,000 depending on the menu

6. Sunrise Hike & Breakfast
For the active couples: wake up early, hike to a scenic spot, watch the sunrise, have breakfast with a view.

It''s romantic, it''s healthy, and the endorphins from exercise naturally put you both in a good mood.

Cost: ₦50,000 - ₦150,000

7. Unplug Completely
This deserves its own category.

Leave your phones in the room. No social media, no emails, no group chats.

Go to the beach, talk, listen, breathe. The most romantic thing you can do is give your partner your undivided attention.

Cost: Free (except accommodation)

Practical Tips to Make Your Getaway Actually Romantic

1. Eliminate Logistics Stress
Work with a resort or venue that handles everything. Don''t spend your romantic getaway troubleshooting logistics.

2. Plan It, But Leave Room for Spontaneity
Have a general outline, but don''t schedule every 15 minutes. Some of the best moments happen when you''re just wandering around.

3. Time It Right
Go during lower tourism season if possible. Fewer crowds mean more peace and quiet.

4. Budget Accordingly
You don''t need to spend a fortune to be romantic. But do set a budget so you''re not stressed about money during the getaway.

5. Make It Regular
One romantic getaway a year isn''t enough. Try to do this quarterly or at least twice a year.

6. Phone Boundaries
Seriously. Put the phones away.

The Bottom Line
Romantic getaways aren''t luxuries. They''re essentials for a healthy relationship.

And you don''t need to leave Lagos to have one.

Intentional time, a good setting, and actual attention to your partner. That''s all you need.

So book something. Choose your adventure. And remember why you fell in love in the first place.', '/ziba-blog/blog-6.png', 'Ziba Beach Resort', 'Travel Tips', 8, NOW(), NOW(), NOW()),

'Day Pass Guide: Make the Most of Your Ziba Beach Day

A day at the beach doesn''t have to be complicated. But it should be intentional.

Whether you''re planning a solo escape, a family outing, or a group celebration, making the most of your time requires a little strategy.

This guide walks you through it.

What''s Included in a Day Pass?
At Ziba Beach Resort, a day pass gets you:

- Access to private beach area (not crowded like public beaches)
- Lounge chairs and beach umbrellas
- Access to bathrooms and shower facilities
- Use of basic beach equipment (depending on your package)
- Discounts on food and beverage ordering
- Access to resort amenities (depending on package level)

Optional add-ons:
- Meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
- Water sports activities
- Spa services
- private cabanas
- Event setup (for celebrations)

Planning Your Day Pass

Step 1: Choose Your Time
What time of day are you most comfortable at the beach?

Early Morning (6 AM - 10 AM): Fewer crowds, cooler weather, great for active people who want to swim or exercise.
Mid-Day (10 AM - 2 PM): Peak hours, warmest weather, busiest, but good for people who like social atmosphere.
Late Afternoon (2 PM - 6 PM): Cooler again, sunset approaching, less crowded, great for relaxation and sunset viewing.
Evening (4 PM onwards): Sunset and into evening. ideal if you want romantic vibes or nightlife feel.

For first-timers: Go in the late afternoon. You get good weather, fewer crowds, and you can stay through sunset.

Step 2: Decide Your Vibe
Solo: Bring a book, journal, podcast. Relax. Let your mind decompress.
Couple: Private spot, minimal distractions, focus on each other.
Friends Group: Lawn games, swimming, socializing, activities focused on group fun.
Family: Mix of activities for different ages, shade for parents, entertainment for kids.

Your vibe determines which add-ons and areas of the resort you use.

Step 3: Come Prepared
- Sunscreen (important!)
- Lightweight cover-up or shirt for shade breaks
- Hat or cap
- Water bottle or hydration plan
- Entertainment (book, phone, music)
- Cash/card for food and extras
- Change of clothes/towel
- Medications or necessities

Step 4: Plan Your Food & Drink
Eating at the resort is more expensive than eating elsewhere. That''s normal at any venue.

But it''s also convenient, and you don''t have to leave the beach to get food.

Option 1: Pre-order meals when you book your day pass. Prices are locked in and food comes out when you want it.

Option 2: Order off the menu as you go. More flexibility, slightly higher prices.

Option 3: Bring snacks/light meals. Depends on the resort''s policy for outside food.

Budget roughly ₦200 - ₦500 per person for food and drinks, depending on what you order.

A Sample Day Pass Timeline

12:00 PM Arrive at resort
12:15 PM Get settled in lounge chair, set up your space
12:30 PM First swim or water activity
1:15 PM Lunch (ordered in advance or from menu)
2:00 PM Rest/relax time, reading, napping, conversation
3:00 PM Another swim or optional activity (massage, water sports)
4:00 PM Snack and drink time
5:00 PM Sunset watching/photography
6:00 PM Casual dinner or light bites
6:30 PM Leave or stay into evening depending on what''s available

Total in-resort time: 6-7 hours (can be adjusted)

How to Maximize Your Experience

1. Arrive Early Enough to Settle
Don''t show up at 4:30 PM and expect to relax. Arrive early enough to find your spot, settle in, and actually let your body adjust.

2. Use the Facilities
Don''t just sit on a chair. Take advantage of showers, bathrooms, maybe a massage, water activities. You''re paying for the access.

3. Spend Time in Water
Don''t just stay on the sand. Get in the water. Swim, float, play. It''s the best part.

4. Disconnect (Somewhat)
Put your phone on Do Not Disturb. Check it once every hour, not every 5 minutes. Actually be present.

5. Stay for Sunset
If the timing works, stay through sunset. It''s worth it. The change in light, the colors, the temperature drop—it''s the best part of the day.

6. Invest in Comfort
Spend the extra for cushioned loungers vs. basic chairs. Spend extra for a cabana if it means you have shade and privacy. Small upgrades compound into a much better experience.

Tips for Different Groups

Solo Visitors:
- Bring entertainment you''re actually excited about
- Don''t feel pressured to be social unless you want to be
- Use the quiet to actually relax and recharge
- Consider a massage or spa treatment as TLC

Couples:
- Request a more private area if available
- Skip peak hours for quieter atmosphere
- Plan a romantic meal in advance

- Budget together so there''s no money awkwardness
- Delegate one person as organizer to coordinate

Families:
- Go when the weather is good but before maximum heat
- Have a mix of supervised and free-play time
- Bring more snacks than you think you''ll need

We''ve seen it happen. And it breaks our hearts.

That''s why we''ve put together this guide on proposal photography—how to get the shots you need without being so focused on cameras that you miss the actual moment.

The Problem with DIY Proposal Photos

Here''s what usually happens:

You ask a friend to take pictures. Good friend. Well-meaning.

But they''re not a photographer. They''re nervous. They''re not sure what angles work. They''re thinking too hard and missing moments.

Or they''re looking at their phone and missing the actual emotional moment because they''re too focused on the frame.

By the time you review the photos later, half of them are blurry, zoomed in randomly, or... not even there.

Why Professional Photography Matters

A professional photographer:

- Knows the angles that work for your body types and the location
- Captures candid moments (your real reaction, her face before she realizes)
- Has backup equipment in case something fails
- Knows how to work with natural light (crucial at sunset)
- Can reframe and focus quickly, catching every moment
- Provides edited, high-quality files you''ll actually want to display

The difference between professional photos and friend photos is literally night and day.

What to Communicate to Your Photographer

Before the proposal, have a clear conversation with your photographer:

1. Timeline: When does the proposal happen? What time of day?
2. Location: Where on the beach? Are there specific landmarks or angles you want featured?
3. Your Partner: Send photos in advance so they know what to expect
4. Setup: Describe how you''re setting it up (candles, flowers, etc.)
5. Vibe: Are you going for romantic and intimate, or celebratory? Professional or candid?
6. The Ring: Do you want close-ups of the ring? Specific shots of it?
7. Contingencies: What if family/friends show up to surprise her? What if the sunset doesn''t happen as planned?

A good photographer will ask these questions. If they don''t, they''re not thinking about your vision.

Positioning and Angles

The Golden Rules:

1. Shoot from multiple angles
You want photos from the front (capture her reaction), side (show you both together), and back (show the beach and sunset).

2. Capture the ring shot
Close-up of the ring on her finger, both hands together, unique angle—these are the money shots people want to see.

3. Use the location as backdrop
The sunset should be visible in at least some photos. The ocean should frame the moment. Use what''s around you.

4. Get candid moments
Yes, get posed shots. But the best photos are the candid ones: her pulling you up to hug, tears flowing, genuine emotion.

5. Lighting matters
Golden hour (sunset time) is ideal. The light is flattering and atmospheric.

Timing Your Proposal Photoshoot

If you''re doing a comprehensive photoshoot:

15 minutes before the proposal: Photographer does location scouting, tests lighting, prepares angles.

Proposal moment: Photographer captures the proposal and immediate reactions.

5-10 minutes after: Couple photos (both of you together), ring shots, celebration photos, family/friends reaction shots.

Total time: 30 minutes to 1 hour.

This might seem long, but it goes fast when emotions are high.

What to Avoid

❌ Don''t let photography stress steal the moment
Your photos shouldn''t be the focus. The moment should. If you''re spending the whole time worrying about angles, you''re missing the experience.

❌ Don''t have too many photographers
One professional photographer (plus maybe one backup camera). More than that gets chaotic.

❌ Don''t do elaborate photo setups during the proposal
Wait until after to pose for multiple angles. The proposal itself should be natural.

❌ Don''t forget to look at her face
Yes, the sunset is beautiful. But HER face is the money shot. Make sure the photographer captures her genuine reaction when she realizes what''s happening.

Budget for Proposal Photography

Professional photographer (2 hours): ₦300,000 - ₦1,000,000+
Second photographer/backup: ₦200,000 - ₦500,000
Edited/printed photos: ₦100,000 - ₦300,000
Albums or prints: ₦150,000 - ₦500,000+

Total: ₦500,000 - ₦2M+ depending on your choices

It''s not cheap. But these are literally the most important photos of your relationship so far.

Worth it.

DIY Alternative (If Budget is Tight)

If you can''t afford a professional:

1. Use a tripod and self-timer for some shots
2. Ask your most photography-savvy friend to help
3. Use natural daylight (sunset is ideal)
4. Do a first-look-style setup where she knows something is happening but not what
5. Focus on being present; perfect photos matter less than the moment

But honestly? Try to find room in the budget for a professional. Your future self will thank you.

Pro Tips from Beach Proposal Photographers

1. Have a backup phone/camera fully charged
2. Bring extra memory cards
3. Scout the location before the actual day
4. Have a shot list but be flexible to capture unexpected moments
5. Communicate with your photographer throughout the entire day
6. Ask them to capture details: flowers, candles, the ring, your face as you''re getting ready

The Bottom Line

Your proposal is a one-time moment. You''ll never get a do-over.

Photos are the only way to relive it and share it with people who couldn''t be there.

Invest in quality photography. It''s not optional.

And more importantly: be present. The best memory isn''t in the photos. It''s in your head, in her reaction, in the feeling of that moment.

Capture it however you can. Just don''t miss it.', '/ziba-blog/blog-8.png', 'Ziba Beach Resort', 'Proposals', 9, NOW(), NOW(), NOW()),

'Wedding Favor Ideas Your Guests Will Actually Appreciate

Wedding favors are tricky.

You want to give your guests something meaningful. But you don''t want to waste money on stuff they''ll throw away.

Here''s the truth: most wedding favors end up in a drawer, never used.

But some do matter. Some get remembered. So how do you bridge that gap?

This guide breaks down favor ideas that people actually keep and appreciate.

What Makes a Good Wedding Favor

It''s useful, or beautiful, or both.
It connects to your wedding (not generic).
It''s not something people already have 10 of.
It''s executed well (quality packaging, presentation).
It can be affordable without looking cheap.

Favor Ideas That Actually Work

1. Artisanal Edibles
Honey, jam, cookies, chocolate, spice blends—made locally or customized for your wedding.

Why it works: People use it. It''s consumed, not just stored. Plus there''s an artisanal/personal touch that feels special.

Cost: ₦500 - ₦2,000 per person

2. Candles (High Quality)
Not the cheap votive candles. Good ones from local makers.

Label them with your names and wedding date.

Why it works: People love candles. They''re decorative and functional. The custom label adds sentiment.

Cost: ₦1,000 - ₦3,000 per person

3. Small Plants or Succulents
A tiny potted succulent or herb plant (clearly they won''t die immediately).

Why it works: Growing something lives longer than cut flowers. Plus they''re Instagram-worthy for decorating desks/windowsills.

Cost: ₦500 - ₦1,500 per person

4. Personalized Drink Bottles or Tumblers
A thermal bottle or nice tumbler with your wedding date or a cute inside joke.

Why it works: People use these constantly. Every time they use it, they remember your wedding.

Cost: ₦1,500 - ₦3,000 per person

5. Handmade Soaps or Bath Bombs
Especially if made locally or customized for your wedding.

Why it works: Luxury self-care item. People appreciate quality bath products.

Cost: ₦800 - ₦2,000 per person

6. Local Coffee or Tea
High-quality, packaged nicely, ideally sourced locally.

Why it works: People drink it. It''s useful. Coffee/tea gifts feel premium even at reasonable prices.

Cost: ₦1,000 - ₦2,500 per person

7. Custom Artwork or Prints
Small framed art with your wedding date or a scene from your venue.

Why it works: Decorative, personal, memorable. People keep art on walls.

Cost: ₦2,000 - ₦5,000 per person

8. Experience Vouchers
Discount vouchers to your favorite local restaurant, spa, or activity.

Why it works: Guests get to experience your favorite places. Useful and thoughtful.

Cost: ₦1,000 - ₦3,000 per person

9. Jewelry (Simple, Nice)
A simple bracelet, ring, or necklace—nothing outrageous, but quality.

Why it works: Wearable. People use it. It feels special.

Cost: ₦2,000 - ₦5,000 per person

10. Books
A book meaningful to your relationship, or a book you think your guests will enjoy.

Why it works: Thoughtful. People who like reading will value it.

Cost: ₦1,200 - ₦2,500 per person

Budget-Friendly Favor Combinations

If you''re looking to combine items:

Basic (₦1,000 - ₦1,500/person): Artisanal edible + small candle
Mid-Range (₦2,000 - ₦3,000/person): Nice beverage + custom tumbler or small plant
Premium (₦3,500 - ₦5,000+/person): Jewelry + artisanal edible + voucher

Presentation Tips

Packaging is 50% of the appeal.
- Invest in decent packaging, not just the item.
- Add a custom label or thank-you tag.
- Group items thoughtfully (don''t just throw things in a bag).
- Make it easy for guests to take (not fragile or bulky).

Ideas:
- Kraft paper boxes with custom stickers
- Reusable jute bags with embroidered initials
- Pretty baskets (guests take home the basket too)
- Decorated boxes with silk ribbons

Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Generic favors
No random keychains or items with no connection to your wedding.

❌ Too much stuff
Guests don''t want to carry 3 pounds of things. Pick 1-2 thoughtful items, not 5 random ones.

❌ Poor quality
Cheap-looking favors scream "didn''t care." Do fewer items well, not many items badly.

❌ Impractical items
Decorative things people won''t use, cheap electronics, items specific to your inside jokes that guests won''t get.

❌ Last-minute rush
Favors ordered hastily often look and feel rushed. Plan early.

Luxury Favor Ideas (If Budget Allows)

- Luxury candles from high-end makers
- Designer small goods (scarves, sunglasses cases)
- Personalized jewelry (engraved cufflinks, bracelets)
- Premium spirits or wine (if guests drink it)
- Luxury chocolate or treats from premium makers

Budget: ₦3,000 - ₦1,0000+ per person

The Bottom Line

Wedding favors don''t need to be expensive or elaborate.

They need to be thoughtful, useful, and quality.

Your guests will remember that you cared enough to give them something nice—not the dollar amount spent.

Choose one or two items you genuinely believe your guests will use and enjoy.

Execute them well.

That''s it.

And if all else fails—good favors are always the ones people actually want to take home. Stack the odds in your favor by choosing items that solve a problem or bring joy, not items that look pretty on the table for five seconds before being forgotten.', '/ziba-blog/blog-9.png', 'Ziba Beach Resort', 'Weddings', 8, NOW(), NOW(), NOW()),

'Hosting a Group Celebration at the Beach: A Complete Guide

Group celebrations at the beach are magic.

The right venue, good people, music, food, ocean breeze...

It''s the recipe for memories.

But execution matters. A lot.

I''ve seen group celebrations at beaches that were chaotic, poorly organized, crowded, and generally unpleasant.

I''ve also seen ones that were absolutely perfect.

The difference is planning.

This guide walks through exactly what you need to know to host a flawless group celebration at the beach.

Types of Group Celebrations

Birthday parties (all ages)
Bachelorette/Bachelor parties
Reunion celebrations (school, family, friend groups)
Corporate events
Charity events
Milestone celebrations (anniversaries, graduations)
Holiday parties

Each has slightly different needs. We''ll address that below.

Basics You Need to Figure Out

1. Guest Count
How many people are you inviting? This drives almost every other decision.
- 10-25 people: Small intimate group, easy to manage
- 25-50 people: Medium group, requires coordination
- 50-100 people: Large celebration, logistics get complex
- 100+ people: Major event, professional planning essential

2. Date and Time
Weekday vs. Weekend? Morning, afternoon, or evening? Holiday or regular day?

Pro tip: Weekday celebrations are usually less expensive and less crowded.

3. Budget
Per-person budget determines food quality, upgrades, entertainment, etc.

Budget low (₦500-1,000/person): Basic food, simple setup, minimal entertainment
Budget mid (₦1,500-3,000/person): Quality food, nice setup, some entertainment
Budget high (₦3,500-5,000+/person): Premium everything, full entertainment, VIP experience

4. Vibe You Want
Chill and relaxed?
Social and high-energy?
Elegant and sophisticated?
Fun and wild?

Your vibe determines everything from music to lighting to food style.

❌ Poor food coordination
Food runs out, or arrives cold, or isn''t what people expected.

❌ Too much structure
Over-scheduling every moment leaves no time for spontaneous fun and connection.

❌ Bad weather contingency
No backup plan if it rains. Your whole event falls apart.

❌ Forgetting to assign roles
No one is in charge of what. Result: chaos.

Pro Tips for Success

1. Assign a coordinator
Someone whose job is to manage timeline, staff issues, and logistics on the day. (This person has a hard job. Thank them.)

2. Do a trial run
If it''s a large celebration, do a walkthrough of setup and timing in advance.

3. Create a runsheet
A detailed timeline of every moment. Give copies to key people (staff, entertainment, etc.)

4. Stay flexible
Plans always change. Have backup options ready.

5. Capture the moment
Hire a photographer. These are the memories you''ll have forever.

6. Send thank-you notes after
Your guests gave their time. Acknowledge that.

The Bottom Line

Hosting a group celebration at the beach is a big undertaking.

'Sustainable Beach Practices: How to Enjoy Responsibly

The beach is beautiful.

And it''s fragile.

Climate change, pollution, overcrowding...the ocean faces real threats.

But as individuals who love the beach, we can take responsibility for protecting it.

This guide covers simple, practical ways to enjoy the beach while being a good steward of the environment.

Why This Matters

The beach isn''t infinite. Our actions have cumulative effects.

One piece of plastic doesn''t seem significant. But multiply it by thousands of people?

Suddenly the ocean is suffering.

That said, you don''t have to be a hardcore environmentalist to make a difference. Small consistent changes add up.

Simple Sustainable Beach Practices

1. Use Reef-Safe Sunscreen
Regular sunscreen contains chemicals that bleach coral.

Reef-safe sunscreen uses mineral-based filters instead.

It''s a small swap, not more expensive, and saves actual ecosystems.

2. Bring Reusable Items
Reusable water bottle (instead of plastic bottles)
Reusable food containers (instead of throwaway packaging)
Reusable shopping bags
Reusable beach towel/robe

Every single-use item you avoid = one less thing in the ocean.

3. Pack Out What You Pack In
This seems obvious but: take ALL trash with you. Candy wrappers, straws, butt ends of sunscreen bottles—everything.

Bonus: Pick up a few extra pieces of trash you find. Be the change.

4. Cut Down on Fish?
This is controversial, but sustainable fisheries matter for ocean health.

If you''re eating seafood at the beach, choose options from sustainable sources (ask restaurants).

5. Conserve Water
Showers after the beach: keep them brief.
Don''t run the tap while brushing teeth.
Simple water conservation adds up in areas where water is scarce.

6. Respect Marine Life
Don''t touch or approach sea animals.
Don''t collect shells in protected areas.
Don''t feed animals (even birds).
Observe from distance; let them live their lives.

7. Avoid Microplastics
Microbeads in cosmetics (some face washes, sunscreens)
Synthetic fabrics release microfibers
Avoid when possible or buy alternatives.

8. Use Eco-Friendly Beach Equipment
Natural wooden chairs instead of plastic loungers
Bamboo accessories instead of plastic
Glass or stainless steel containers instead of plastic

9. Support Responsible Businesses
Choose beach resorts, restaurants, and vendors that prioritize sustainability.

Vote with your money.

10. Reduce Your Carbon Footprint
Drive less (carpool, use public transport to the beach)
Offset air travel if you''re flying to a beach destination
Choose resorts with renewable energy practices

Bigger Actions (If You''re Passionate)

- Join beach cleanup initiatives
- Support ocean conservation nonprofits
- Advocate for policy changes around plastic bans
- Volunteer for marine education programs
- Reduce your overall consumption (less stuff = less waste)

Sustainable Beach Practices for Group Celebrations

If you''re hosting a celebration:

- Use reusable plates/cups instead of disposables
- Provide water stations with reusable cups
- Minimize single-use plastics in catering
- Plan for waste management (separate recycling)
- Use LED lighting for events (energy efficient)
- Buy local, seasonal food for catering

How Ziba Beach Resort Approaches Sustainability

They''re implementing:
- Reef-safe sunscreen recommendations
- Waste reduction programs
- Community beach cleanups
- Sustainable food sourcing
- Energy-efficient operations
- Water conservation initiatives

Ask them about their sustainability practices and support resorts that prioritize the environment.

The Reality Check

You don''t have to be perfect.

Sustainable living isn't about shame or judgment.

It''s about incremental improvement.

If 1,000 people make one small change, that''s 1,000 changes.

Start with whatever resonates with you:
- Maybe it''s reef-safe sunscreen.
- Maybe it''s bringing a reusable water bottle.
- Maybe it''s picking up extra trash.

Pick one thing. Do it consistently. Then add another.

Before you know it, your beach habits are genuinely sustainable.

And the ocean thanks you.

Discussion Questions to Ask Yourself

- What''s one piece of single-use plastic I can eliminate from my beach trips?
- Which sustainable practice feels easiest for me to adopt?
- What''s one action I can take this month to be a better ocean steward?
- How can I influence my friend group to make sustainable choices?
- What would make me feel more connected to ocean conservation?

The Bottom Line

Loving the beach and protecting it aren''t mutually exclusive.

They''re interconnected.

Every choice you make—from sunscreen to transportation—either contributes to the ocean''s health or detracts from it.

Choose wisely.

Enjoy the beach responsibly.

And help ensure that future generations get to experience the magic that drew you there in the first place.
